## Second chapter
In this chapter, I learned how variable declarations work, explored different data types, and discovered literals (which I initially amusingly referred to as "literatures", `lol`). I also studied constants, their possible types, and the concept of untyped constants. Additionally, I learned how Go handles unused variables.
